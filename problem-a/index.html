    <p>Lightning McQueen is the protagonist of the <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/">Cars</a></cite> series. He is a red race car that seeks to win the piston cup within his races. I admire this character because: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>He is ambitious and competetive</li>
        <li>He has character development</li> 
        <li class="importantPara">Hes fast</li>
